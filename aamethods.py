(Chapter 3) In order to understand the linguistics of computers,
there needs to be an systematic methodology to study the patterns.
Thereâ€™s context-free grammars (CFGs), a set of rewrite rules, which describes
computer languages and captures structures and their dependencies.
This is the most complex methodology and the intermediate model is
Markov chains, capturing short-range dependencies based probabilistic tree
branches. However, this method moves long-term through short-term connections,
which is sometimes not as efficient. The patterns of linguistics and word
patterns can be analyzed with statistics, especially laws of distribution and
variation. Established information can be used to guess the next chain of words.
Another type of model is the vector space models that can used with another
method to identify dependencies and correlations. So in conclusion there are
3 phases to authorship attribution. Canonicization, deperating and treating
similar realizations as identical. Second is determination of the event set,
which is partitioned into individual non-overlapping events and statiscal
inference, which is using numbers and data to guess .
(Chapter 5: Attributional Analysis)
After the elements of a document have been extracted,
the data need to be analyzed. One of the ways is to use a vector space
to represent the document space. Visually analyzing two vector spaces, if
similar, will be highly indicative of the same author. However, large spaces
are hard to analyze. Principal component analysis (PCA) implements eigenvalues
to consolidate and visualize the matrices. Another method of analysis is
Multidimensional scaling, which places objects in a space of a previously
defined dimension and examined for patterns. THe 3rd method is cluster
analysis . Essentially, the methods of analysis involve statistics, computer
science, geometry, and a lot of linear algebra and Markov chains. Machine Learning
is used with 3 main components, neural networks, decision trees, and Bayes classifiers.
